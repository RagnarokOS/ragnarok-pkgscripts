# pkgscripts

Set of scripts for Ragnarok package management. These are wrapper scripts
arround [emerge(1)](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Full_manpages/emerge).

Ragnarok separates the base system (@world) from user installed "third
party" packages, and these scripts are required to propely handle the
base system + packages.
